So the current maven-jarsigner-plugin operates by invoking the command line jarsigner.
  I want to create a new one that operates by calling the methods in the main.class
  associated with the jarsigner in the SUN code base. I will probably extract the
  methods and objectize things a bit so I don't have to deal with all of the MAIN
  argument parsing (nor the hundreds of variants).
  
  In my case the AWS KMS JCE Provider will already be part of the process and the
  dependency set. Maybe Bouncy Castle too??
